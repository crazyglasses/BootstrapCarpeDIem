# BootstrapCarpeDIem
As part of the problem statement provided by Unacademy, our team, Carpe_Diem is trying to come up with a. solution to the problem of segregating the background of a live video . The goal is the live stream a video with the following transformations:
1)	Remove the background ( With green screen)
2)	In addition to step 1, remove the background of the image irrespective of the kind of background ( arbitrary , non green screen ).
3)	Merge the video with a second stream ( Slide show or Drawing canvas ) 
4)	Integrate it with a streaming platform.
5)	All of the above on a live stream with a focus on reduced latency, increased frame rate and quality.
